### Node-Level Measures (for each `Node`/Twitter User)
These measures tell you about the importance, activity, and connectedness of **individual users** within your Twitter network.

1.  **`Node`**:
    * **Role:** This is simply the **unique identifier for each Twitter user** in your network (e.g., "User_1", "Alice", "@influencerXYZ"). It's the primary key for each row of data.
    * **Practical Use:** Allows you to link the quantitative measures back to specific users you are analyzing.

2.  **`In_Degree`**:
    * **Role:** The count of **incoming connections** to a user. In a Twitter interaction network where edges represent mentions, replies, or follows, this is the number of times a user has been **mentioned, replied to, or followed** by other users.
    * **Practical Use:** A high `In_Degree` suggests a user is a **target of attention**, a **receiver of information**, or someone who is **popular/respected enough to be referenced**. It's a strong indicator of **visibility** and **attractiveness** as an influencer.

3.  **`Out_Degree`**:
    * **Role:** The count of **outgoing connections** from a user. This is the number of times a user has **mentioned, replied to, or followed** other users.
    * **Practical Use:** A high `Out_Degree` indicates an **active, proactive communicator** or **information disseminator**. These users are reaching out, engaging, and contributing to conversations. It signifies **engagement** and **proactiveness**.

4.  **`Total_Degree`**:
    * **Role:** The sum of a user's `In_Degree` and `Out_Degree`. It represents the total number of direct connections (interactions) a user has.
    * **Practical Use:** A general measure of a user's **overall activity and connectedness**. Users with high total degree are simply very involved in the network.

5.  **`In_Degree_Centrality`**:
    * **Role:** The `In_Degree` value normalized by the maximum possible in-degree in the network (i.e., divided by `N-1`, where N is the total number of users). This allows for comparison across networks of different sizes.
    * **Practical Use:** Provides a **relative measure of a user's prestige or popularity**. A high value means a user is mentioned/followed by a very large proportion of other users in the network, making them highly visible and potentially a **major influencer based on inbound attention**.

6.  **`Out_Degree_Centrality`**:
    * **Role:** The `Out_Degree` value normalized by the maximum possible out-degree (`N-1`).
    * **Practical Use:** Provides a **relative measure of a user's activity or gregariousness**. A high value means a user is actively engaging with a large proportion of others, suggesting they are a **significant information broadcaster or connector**.

7.  **`Closeness_Centrality`**:
    * **Role:** Measures how "close" a user is to all other users in the network. It's calculated as the inverse of the average shortest path length from that user to all other reachable users.
    * **Practical Use:** Users with high `Closeness_Centrality` can **quickly disseminate information** to or **receive information from** others in the network. They are efficient communicators and are **not far from anyone** else in the network. These are often important for rapid information flow.

8.  **`Betweenness_Centrality`**:
    * **Role:** Quantifies the extent to which a user lies on the shortest communication paths between other pairs of users in the network. If a user is removed, how many shortest paths would break?
    * **Practical Use:** A high `Betweenness_Centrality` indicates a user is a **"bridge"** or **"gatekeeper"** connecting different parts of the network. They control the flow of information between otherwise disconnected groups. These users are crucial for **information brokering** and **power** within the network.

9.  **`Eigenvector_Centrality`**:
    * **Role:** Measures a user's influence based on their connections to other *high-scoring* users. A user is important if they are connected to other important users.
    * **Practical Use:** This is a strong indicator of **true influence** or **"clout"**. It identifies users who are well-connected within influential circles, rather than just having many connections. If you're looking for opinion leaders or trendsetters, this is a key metric.

10. **`Clustering_Coefficient`**:
    * **Role:** For a specific user, it measures the likelihood that their direct connections are also connected to each other. In simpler terms, "are my friends also friends with each other?"
    * **Practical Use:** A high `Clustering_Coefficient` suggests a user is part of a **tight-knit community or clique**. These users are good for reinforcing existing beliefs within a group, but might not be good for spreading information to new, unconnected parts of the network. Low clustering might indicate a "connector" who bridges different groups.

### Graph-Level Measures (for the entire Twitter Network)

These measures describe the overall structure and properties of your entire Twitter interaction network. They appear only on the first row of your CSV as they describe the whole dataset.

1.  **`Graph_Density`**:
    * **Role:** The ratio of the actual number of connections (edges) in the network to the maximum possible number of connections if every user was connected to every other user.
    * **Practical Use:** A high `Graph_Density` (closer to 1) means your Twitter network is **highly interconnected**, with many users interacting. A low density (closer to 0) means it's sparse, with fewer interactions relative to its potential. It tells you how **active and saturated** the overall interaction is.

2.  **`Graph_Reciprocity`**:
    * **Role:** In a directed network (like Twitter where A can follow B, but B might not follow A back), this measures the proportion of connections that are mutual. If User A replies to User B, does User B also reply to User A?
    * **Practical Use:** A high `Graph_Reciprocity` (closer to 1) indicates a network where interactions are **often mutual**, suggesting more balanced and established relationships. Low reciprocity implies more one-sided or broadcast-like interactions.

3.  **`Graph_Transitivity`**:
    * **Role:** Also known as the global clustering coefficient. It's the probability that two users connected to a common third user are also connected to each other. It counts closed "triangles" in the network.
    * **Practical Use:** A high `Graph_Transitivity` (closer to 1) suggests a network with a strong tendency for **cliques or tightly-knit groups** to form. It indicates a high level of "friend-of-my-friend is also my friend" relationships.

4.  **`Graph_In_Degree_Centralization`**:
    * **Role:** Measures the extent to which a small number of users dominate the inbound attention in the network. If it's high, a few users receive a disproportionately large number of mentions/follows.
    * **Practical Use:** A high value implies a **star-like structure for inbound attention**, where the network revolves around a few highly popular or authoritative figures. It indicates a **centralized flow of influence** where a few users are overwhelming recipients of attention.

5.  **`Graph_Out_Degree_Centralization`**:
    * **Role:** Measures the extent to which a small number of users dominate the outbound communication in the network. If it's high, a few users are doing most of the mentioning/replying.
    * **Practical Use:** A high value suggests a **star-like structure for outbound communication**, where a few users are highly active broadcasters or information disseminators. It indicates a **centralized source of communication** from a few key individuals.

By analyzing these measures, particularly `In_Degree`, `Eigenvector_Centrality`, and `Betweenness_Centrality` at the node-level, you can effectively identify different types of "influencers" in your Twitter network: those who are popular, those who are truly influential within powerful circles, and those who act as critical bridges. The graph-level measures will tell you about the overall structure and health of the network your influencers operate within.
